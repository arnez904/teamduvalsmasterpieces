# APP - *AirDelivery App*

## Overview

Description 

**AirDelivery** American Airlines travelers have the issue of not having a centralized place for making requests to flight attendants, in effect, the travelers have to wait at an interval amount of time to be able to place a request. These travelers also never know what's on the flight's amenities, this will also help slow the transmission of diseases.

Goal

**AirDelivery** To have a centralized app for travelers to queue in requests for flight attendants, ultimately leading to a better traveling experience.
